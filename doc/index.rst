Flux CORAL2
===========

The Flux CORAL2 project contains Flux plugins and other add-ons required
for Flux to run as the primary resource manager on HPE Cray EX and similar
systems.  This includes
`El Capitan <https://www.top500.org/news/el-capitan-achieves-top-spot-frontier-and-aurora-follow-behind/>`_,
a relatively large one.

Documentation is currently under construction.
